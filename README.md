I have no idea what I am doing.

Productivity app has four main components to it. First, we have an app similar to memoryPie to help the user memorize sentences. A flashcard app enhanced with AI features to help the user smoothly memorize terms. A grade calculator for those curious about what they need on the final to get a certain overall grade. Finally, a Pomodoro timer helps users be more productive and spend their time efficiently. These mini-apps will help the user be more productive, have better studying habits, and understand what they need on tests to succeed.

Alas, we still have no idea what we are doing.
